    <p>Hi! My name is <b>Lara</b>, and I am a <b>PhD student in <em>Linguistics</em> at the University of Edinburgh</b>, based at the <b>School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences</b>.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Bilbao, the <b>Basque Country</b>, a bilingual community. I was raised bilingual in a One Parent One Language environment: my mother only spoke to me in <em>Spanish</em> and my father only spoke to me in <em>English</em>.</p>
    <p>I learnt <em>Basque</em> as an L2 at school and <em>French</em> in high school. During my BA, I completed an Erasmus+ programme in Bologna, Italy, where I learnt <em>Italian</em>. I am currently learning <em>Turkish</em>.</p>
